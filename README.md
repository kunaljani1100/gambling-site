# Gambling Site

This is a gambling application that has been developed using sinatra, which is the web development framework for ruby. In this game, a user bets a certain value from 1 to 6 
with the expectation that the number that the user bets will match the number that will show up when the die is rolled. If the number on the die matches the number the user put
for a bet, then the user wins the money, otherwise the user loses money. The total winnings and losses are shown to the user so that the user can keep a track on how much he 
won or lost. This ensures that the user is a responsible gambler.
